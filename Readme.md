This project is a **dynamic load balancer** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Bun**, capable of:

- Automatically spawning and managing backend instances.
- Performing regular **health checks** on each instance.
- **Auto-scaling** instances up or down based on live load.
- Forwarding incoming requests to the least loaded healthy instance.
- Exposing an internal status endpoint for monitoring.

---

## 📦 Features

- 🏁 **Instance Spawning**: Launches multiple instances of a backend app using `bun`.
- 💓 **Health Checks**: Regularly checks if each instance is healthy (`/health` endpoint).
- 📈 **Auto-Scaling**:

  - Scales **up** when the load is high.
  - Scales **down** when instances are idle.

- 🚥 **Load-Aware Routing**: Requests are routed to the instance with the **lowest load**.
- 🚦 **Status Endpoint**: `/lb-status` shows live info about active instances.

## 🔧 Configuration (`config.yaml`)

Here's the configuration format:

```yaml
location: "../backend/src/bin.ts" # Path to the Bun entry point
minInstances: 2 # Minimum number of instances
maxInstances: 8 # Maximum number of instances
checkInterval: 5000 # Health + scaling check interval (ms)
healthTimeout: 2000 # Timeout for health checks (ms)
scaleUpThreshold: 3 # Avg load to trigger scale-up
scaleDownThreshold: 0.5 # Avg load to trigger scale-down
idleTimeout: 30000 # Time before an idle instance is removed (ms)
```

> 💡 Ensure your backend exposes a `/health` endpoint that returns `200 OK` when healthy.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Also install `bun` globally if you haven’t already:

```bash
npm install -g bun
```

### 2. Prepare the Backend App

Ensure your backend app:

- Can be run via `bun run path/to/app.ts --port 1234`
- Accepts a `--port` flag.
- Exposes a working `/health` endpoint.

Example `/health` response:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

### 3. Configure the Balancer

Edit the `config.yaml` with the correct backend entry path and parameters.

---

## ✅ Running the Load Balancer

```bash
bun start
# or if you're using ts-node:
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

This starts the load balancer on port **4000** (default) and spawns the `minInstances` of your backend.

---

## 🌐 Endpoints

### 🔁 Proxy Handler

All requests will be forwarded to healthy backend instances:

```http
GET /api/your-endpoint -> proxied to backend instance
```

### 📊 Status Monitor

```http
GET /lb-status
```

Returns live status of all instances:

```json
{
  "total": 3,
  "healthy": 3,
  "instances": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "port": 5001,
      "healthy": true,
      "activeRequests": 0,
      "totalRequests": 10,
      "responseTime": 123,
      "load": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🛑 Graceful Shutdown

The load balancer listens for `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` and will:

- Kill all backend instances.
- Clear health and scaling intervals.

---

## 🧠 How Load Balancing Works

- **Health Checks**: Every few seconds, all instances are pinged on `/health`.
- **Routing Logic**:

  - Requests are routed to the instance with the **least load** (based on active requests + response time).

- **Scaling**:

  - **Scale Up**: When average load > `scaleUpThreshold`.
  - **Scale Down**: When average load < `scaleDownThreshold` and idle time > `idleTimeout`.

---

## 📌 Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Bun (for spawning backend instances)
- A compatible backend app exposing a `/health` route
